\section{Our task}

% TODO basically a copy of the task description and/or the specification

% Ancsi: Nem kell a dolgokat {} közé tenni, csak ritkán (akkor, ha alkalmazni
% akarsz rájuk valami olyan makrót, ami ilyen blokkokra teljesül, pl \scriptsize
% (de ilyet csak kivételes esetekben csinálunk)
% A sorok végére sem kell tenni \\-t, hanem egy sort kihagyva érjük el, hogy új
% paragrafus legyen
% Az ilyen TODO jellegű dolgokat pedig kommentbe tegyük (%-kal kezdődő sor)
% -- Berci

Our job was to do the preparation of installing driverless autonomous vehicles
to offer transportation service to the workers at a private office park.

We had to identify the stakeholders and model the context of the planned system,
and also to define the high-level requirements, necessary functions and use
cases. We also documented non-trivial terms in a glossary as well as the
ambiguous or contradicting requirements so that we can contact the customer with
well-defined questions.

We had to study the appendices, then we had to look through and discuss the
questions that had arisen.

% TODO: The goal of the project???


\section{Ambiguous requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interpretation of ‘make sure the buses are not overcrowded’

		Ideas:

		\textit{The buses form a network that is capable of
			intelligently deciding which bus to ‘send’ where, in
			accordance to the number of people requesting the bus at
			the terminals, what routes other buses have planned and
			how many people are on certain buses. This approach is
			to solve the problem mentioned above; overcrowding can
			be avoided provided there is a sufficient number of
			vehicles at our disposal and the buses can autonomously
			decide their routes in such a way that no single bus is
			full while others are almost empty. Essentially, we
			could balance the number of passengers on the buses.}

	\item What does a request contain of? Who can publish a request?

		Ideas:

		\textit{The request must contains the indentification of the
			worker who ordered the bus, the number of passengers who
			will travel, the starting point, the destination, and
			the planned time of the trip. To publish a request
			needed an authentication to avoid unauthorized access.}

	\item Can the passenger change his/her destination during the
		transportation?

		Ideas:

		\textit{No, but the passengers can get off the vehicle before
			their former destination if they indicate their
			intention in time.}
\end{enumerate}


\section{List of stakeholders}

% Ancsi: Erre van egy külön environment: description
%
% Úgy működik, hogy a \item-ek után írsz egy [] közé valamit, ami a magyarázandó
% szó, majd utána írod is a magyarázatot. pl:
%
% \begin{description}
% 	\item[HTTP] HyperText Transfer Protocol
%	\item[MPLS] MultiProtocol Label Switching
% 	\item[SMTP] Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
% \end{description}
%
% (itt ennél kicsit mást használtam, hogy még szebb legyen, de az egy package
% által működik csak (enumitem))
%
% Persze lehet szebbben formázni, ahogy lent tettem, mert hosszúak a sorok.
