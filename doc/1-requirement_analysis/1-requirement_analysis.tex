\section{Our task}

% TODO basically a copy of the task description and/or the specification
{Our job was to do the preparation of installing driverless autonomous vehicles to offer transportation service to the workers.}\\
{We had to identify the stakeholders and model the context of the future system, and also to define the high-level requirements, necessery functions and use cases. We also documented non-trivial terms in a glossary and the ambiguous or contradicting requirements so that we can contact the customer with well-defined questions.}\\
{We had to study the appendices, then we had to look through and discuss the questions that arised.}\\

{TODO: The goal of the project???}\\
