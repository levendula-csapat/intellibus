\section{Our task}

% Ancsi: Nem kell a dolgokat {} közé tenni, csak ritkán (akkor, ha alkalmazni
% akarsz rájuk valami olyan makrót, ami ilyen blokkokra teljesül, pl \scriptsize
% (de ilyet csak kivételes esetekben csinálunk)
% A sorok végére sem kell tenni \\-t, hanem egy sort kihagyva érjük el, hogy új
% paragrafus legyen
% -- Berci

Our job was to do the preparation of installing \gls{driverless}
\gls{autonomous} \gls{vehicle}s in order to offer \gls{transportation} service
to the workers at a private office park.

We had to identify the \gls{stakeholder}s, model the context of the planned
system, and also to define the high-level requirements, necessary functions and
use cases. We also documented non-trivial terms in a glossary as well as the
ambiguous or contradicting requirements so as to be able to contact the customer
with well-defined questions.

We were to study the appendices, which arose some new questions that we
discussed.


% ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Ambiguities and our ideas}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Interpretation of ‘make sure the buses are not overcrowded’

		\textit{The buses form a network that is capable of
			intelligently deciding which bus to ‘send’ where, in
			accordance to the number of people \gls{request}ing the
			bus at the \gls{terminal}s, what \gls{route}s other
			buses have planned, and how many people are on certain
			buses. Overcrowding can be avoided provided there is a
			sufficient number of \gls{vehicle}s at our disposal and
			the buses can \gls{autonomous}ly decide their
			\gls{route}s in such a way that no single bus is full
			while others are on low capacity. Essentially, we could
			balance the number of passengers on the buses.}

	\item What does a \gls{request} contain? Who can publish a
	      \gls{request}?

		\textit{The \gls{request} must contain the indentification of
			the worker who ordered the bus, the number of passengers
			who will travel, the starting point, the destination,
			and the planned time of the trip. Requests can be made
			from the installed terminals by anybody—this does not
			introduce a problem, since the system operates inside a
			closed-off, private office park—but in order to use
			the \gls{mobileApplication}, registration is needed.}

	\item Can passengers change their destination during the trip?

		\textit{Passengers should not be able to select new
			destionations after they already boarded on of the
			buses. Should a passenger need to abort their current
			trip and travel somewhere else for whatever reason, they
			are urged to get off anywhere where the bus would
			normally stop and \gls{request} a new lift from there.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Use cases}

\begin{description}[style=nextline]
	\item[Make \gls{request} via \gls{mobileApplication}]
		Use the \gls{mobileApplication} designed especially for this
		system to make a \gls{request} for a lift. Only registered users
		may make \gls{request}s this way. The \gls{request} includes the
		user's identification, the date and time of the travel, their
		starting and destination point, as well as the number of people
		who wish to travel in case of a group \gls{request}.

	\item[Make \gls{request} via \gls{terminal}]
		Use the installed \gls{terminal}s in front of every office
		building to make a tranportation \gls{request}. When making a
		\gls{request} this way, only the travel destionation can—and
		must—be specified.

	\item[Monitor system status]
		Periodically check if the entire system is operating as
		expected—ie an appropriate number of buses is in operation (with
		regard to the number of users at the moment), the buses
		calculate \gls{route}s correctly and do not develop any faults.
		It must also be checked that the platforms for making
		\gls{request}s are fully operational.

	\item[Monitor bus condition]
		Keep watch on the various parameters of a bus to make sure it is
		functioning adequately.

	\item[Monitor bus position]
		Keep track of the positions of the buses to make sure they are
		located where they are supposed to be at any given time.

	\item[Avoid causing accidents]
		Ensure the buses cause harm to neither their environment nor
		their passengers. This is largely accomplished by collecting
		data from a variety of \gls{sensor}s and reacting in every
		situation intelligently, and handling unexpected occurrences.

	\item[Drive bus]
		Control the movement of a bus in order to fulfill the main
		purpose of the system: to transport passengers.

	\item[Find alternative \gls{route}]
		When a bus cannot run on a given \gls{route} (which can occur
		due to a variety of reasons) it must find an alternative
		\gls{route} to reach its destination provided such a path
		exists. The buses are aware of the road layout of the office
		park.

	\item[Select \gls{route}]
		The act of choosing a path between two locations in the office
		park, preferably the shortest.

	\item[Transport passengers]
		Get passengers to their desired destinations.

	\item[Manage \gls{request}s]
		Take \gls{request}s from users and use them to \gls{route} the
		buses in such a way that the \gls{request}s are carried out
		efficiently and quickly.

	\item[Monitor environment]
		The buses are aware of their surrounding area using several
		\gls{sensor}s installed for this purpose.

	\item[Notify mechanics]
		In case of a fault the bus ‘calls’ for repairs. Repairs can be
		made either remotely or manually. When possible, the buses
		return to the nearest \gls{terminal} where such repairs can be
		made.

	\item[Repair and maintain]
		Fix any potential problems with a bus and keep it in shape for
		continued usage.

	\item[Travel]
		Use the system to get from point A to point B.
