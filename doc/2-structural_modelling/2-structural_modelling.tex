\section{Our task}

Our job was to design crucial functional components including a couple of
subsystems for the IntelliBus system.

First, we had to complete the Block Definition Diagram of the \emph{Automated
Passenger Counting} functionality with traceability relationships between the
requirements and design artefacts. Documentation for this subtask can be found
at \cref{subsec:apc}.

Our next task was the bottom-up design of an \emph{Intelligent Intersection
Control} subsystem. We realized a specific junction—named J42— using the
conponents defined in the vendor catalog (which was given to us in the form of a
Block Definition Diagram). See our solution at \cref{subsec:j42}.

Finally, we created the top-down design of the \emph{Traffic and Route Planning}
functionality. For this task we used information and components provided by the
two previous tasks. See \cref{subsec:trp}.

\section{Ambiguities and our ideas}

% TODO
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The layout of the T-intersection (J42)

		\textit{Each of the three roads has one incoming and one
			outgoing lane and there are three pedestrian
			crossings—one for each road.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Solutions}

\subsection{Traceability links for the Automated Passenger Counting (APC)}%
\label{subsec:apc}

As per requirement \texttt{REQ1.1}, the buses must monitor the number of
passengers boarding and alighting. This is realized by the
\texttt{PassengerCounter} component which is to be installed into the doors of
every vehicle. There is an extra dependability requirement for this counting
functionality, which of course also must be safisfied by the
\texttt{PassengerCounter}.

\sloppy
The \texttt{PassengerCounter} is a special kind of \texttt{PassengerDetector}.
Another kind is the \texttt{PassengerRecognizer}, which is responsible not for
counting the passengers, but idefntifying them in order to keep track of who is
where. Requirement \texttt{REQ1.2} expects this functionality, which is
satisfied by this component. Similarly to \texttt{REQ1.1}, the dependability
requirement is also satisfied by the recognizer component. Also, all buses have
\texttt{PassengerRecognizer}s installed at every door.

Lastly, as requirement \texttt{REQ1.3} states, data collected by passenger
monitoring must be reported to a central system. This is done by the
\texttt{PassengerMonitoringModule}, which is responsible for keeping track of
passengers in general.

\subsection{Junction \#42 structure (IIC)}
\label{subsec:j42}

Junction 42 is a simple T-intersection, where a road coming from the west meets
a north to south road. We imagined the intersection layout as seen on
\cref{fig:j42}. Each of the three arms has a pedestrian crossing and a traffic
light (represented as a red triangle in the figure).

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[%
		scale=.4,
		road/.style={very thick},%
		zebra/.style={thick},%
		lamp/.style={%
			scale=.5,
			draw,%
			regular polygon,%
			regular polygon sides=3,%
			fill=red}
		]

		% west lane
		\draw[road] (1,4)--(4,4);
		\draw[road] (1,6)--(4,6);
		% north–south lane
		\draw[road] (4,9)--(4,6);
		\draw[road] (4,4)--(4,1);
		\draw[road] (6,9)--(6,1);
		% west pedestrian crossing
		\draw[zebra] (2.5,4.4)--(3.5,4.4);
		\draw[zebra] (2.5,4.8)--(3.5,4.8);
		\draw[zebra] (2.5,5.2)--(3.5,5.2);
		\draw[zebra] (2.5,5.6)--(3.5,5.6);
		% north pedestrian crossing
		\draw[zebra] (4.4,7.5)--(4.4,6.5);
		\draw[zebra] (4.8,7.5)--(4.8,6.5);
		\draw[zebra] (5.2,7.5)--(5.2,6.5);
		\draw[zebra] (5.6,7.5)--(5.6,6.5);
		% south pedestrian crossing
		\draw[zebra] (4.4,3.5)--(4.4,2.5);
		\draw[zebra] (4.8,3.5)--(4.8,2.5);
		\draw[zebra] (5.2,3.5)--(5.2,2.5);
		\draw[zebra] (5.6,3.5)--(5.6,2.5);
		% traffic lights
		\node[lamp,rotate=-90] at (2,4.5) {};
		\node[lamp] at (4.4,8) {};
		\node[lamp,rotate=180] at (5.6,2) {};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Our interpretation of J42's layout}%
	\label{fig:j42}
\end{figure}

We have created the Internal Block Diagram seen on \cref{fig:ibd-j42}. We
included the various control and information flows between the modules. The
traffic light at each pedestrian crossing is influenced by the pedestrian call
buttons. Each lane is also equipped with a vehicle detector.

\subsection{Traffic and Route Planning}%
\label{subsec:trp}

As the most complicated task, we had to design the structural model of the
Traffic and Route Planning functionality.

Please see a Block Definition Diagram on \cref{fig:bdd-trp} which includes all
components used. The functionality is described on the following four Internal
Block Diagrams:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \texttt{IntersectionControl}

		Explains the relations and communication between the central
		traffic management system and intersection control units. See
		\cref{fig:ibd-intersectioncontrol}.

	\item \texttt{Maintenance}

		Communication between the autonomous vehicles and maintenance
		manager components. See \cref{fig:ibd-maintenance}.

	\item \texttt{RoutePlanning}

		An functionality of crucial importance is the ability to devise
		routes based on various factors. The
		\texttt{ServiceRoutePlanner} is largely responsible for this.
		Find the diagram on \cref{fig:ibd-routeplanning}.

	\item \texttt{TrafficManagement}

		Explains the internal structure of the central traffic
		management component and how it communicates with sensors and
		vehicles. See \cref{fig:ibd-trafficmanagement}.
\end{enumerate}
