\section{Our task}

We were assigned to model the behaviour of some components related to boarding
using state machine and activity diagrams.

First, we modelled the operation of the bus's doors by means of a state machine
diagram. The behaviour of the doors was already defined in some specific cases
on sequence diagrams, which we made sure to conform to.

Secondly, we created an activity diagram describing the \gls{RFIDScanner} based
on the textual user manual.

As a final task, we made another state machine diagram which models the
behaviour of the \gls{boardingController} based on the other components'
behaviourâ€”diagrams for some components have been given to us, such as the
\gls{turnstile}'s state machine diagram. We made sure to adhere to the critical
requirements.

\subsection{The state machine representation of the door's behaviour}

The door intutively has two states: \texttt{Opened} and \texttt{Closed}. We have
added an additional \texttt{Closing} state to model the situation when the
\gls{boardingController} has instructed the door to close, but it is blocked by
something (eg a passenger). In this case, the door keeps trying to close until
successful.

Successfully transitioning into the \texttt{Opened} and \texttt{Closed} states
results in respective \texttt{Opened} and \texttt{Closed} signals being sent.

For the sake of completeness, we also added transitions that loop back to the
same state (for example upon receiving an \texttt{Open} signal in the
\texttt{Opened} state).

See \cref{fig:stm-door} for the state machine diagram.
